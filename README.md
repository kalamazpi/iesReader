OR

# Limitations

* This version does not support TILT=filename.
* This version only supports IESNA:LM-63-2002.  Other versions may work by accident.
* This version does not work in Windows PowerShell due to characterset encoding bs with '>'. 
   It must be used with cmd.exe if you want to be able to read in a file that was previously
   generated by iesParser.  Or you can go here: 
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40098771/changing-powershells-default-output-encoding-to-utf-8
   ... and read how to change the default encoding in PowerShell to utf8.
   * This worked for me on PowerShell: $PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
   * This will not be an issue when the script actually names the output file and doesn't rely on '>'.
